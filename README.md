## Logic Gate Implementation using perceptron
 
1 Implement a single-layer perceptron model in Python to classify binary inputs using a step activation function. Test its performance on a simple binary classification problem.

2 Utilize the single perceptron to simulate basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT). Design the perceptron architecture to classify inputs based on predefined threshold values.

3 Extend the perceptron implementation to simulate complex logic gates (NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR). Validate the outputs using different combinations of binary inputs.
